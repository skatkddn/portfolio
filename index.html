Hi, my name is Sang Woo Nam, a HCDE graduate student. I graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design majoring in interactive design,
and have some professional experience as a UX designer. I under stand the user experience design process and computer programming based on 
several projects such as making reponsive webpages, prototypes for applications and I have passion of creating services which have accessibilities 
that make users being able to use them anywhere and also give convenience to users. 
I'm excited to take this programming class and look forward to learn new programming skills.
